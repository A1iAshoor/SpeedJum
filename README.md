SpeedJum
========

iOS Mobile Game Project Inspired by **Nokia Bounce Classic** and the concept of the pulled popular game **Flappy Bird**. This game is meant to bring Nokia Bounce Classic game to life in the AppStore but due to shortage of time and getting busy I decided to make it an endless one level game.

It's built using Xcode (ObjectiveC), Cocos2d Game Engine & SpriteBuilder. I decided to put the source code of this game on Github so maybe someone want to contribute and make this happen, a leveled game. The gmae is already on the AppStore and has more than 400 downloads since March 2014 and most of them are from the US. *[Jun 7 2014]*
